The first week of Software Engineering gave me an idea of how the rest of the semester is going to be. Professor Downing's teaching style is something that i was not expecting. He calls on students randomly to discuss topics that are in lecture that day. What i like about that, is the fact that Professor downing does not make you feel stupid if you dont know the answer. Instead, he walks you through the problem and makes you undesrtand what is happening. I really love that because when i been called and dont know the answer, after having that 1 on 1 discussion, i actually retain everything we discussed.
