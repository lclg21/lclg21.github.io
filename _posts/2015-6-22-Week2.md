title: Week 2
---

My second week of class went by so quickly. We had our first project due on Tuesday and it took me longer than expected. But i feel that it helped me get familiarize with the tools that were required for the project, including github. I never used it before and now i feel more comfortable with it. We also went over new things in python, operators and iterators. Since i have taken courses that use python for the projects, a lot of the code we went over in class was not new for me, so those days were a little easier for me. 

Also, Professor Downing took more than half a lecture to go over project 2, Netflix. I like that because he explains in detail what we need to do, what files to use, what he recommends for us to do, and any other tips for that particular project. And even if he is going over the project he does not stop interacting with the students, which makes me be always ready for any type of question. 

Overall, this week was very satisfactory. Learned a few things about python and was called twice by the professor which is something i am still getting used to. 

TIP OF THE WEEK: Jott, Airchat app that allows users to send data and texts without a connection to the Internet. It uses Bluetooth and WiFi radios to create a closed network with other devices that are within 100-feet of each other. Source: http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/19/technology/jott/index.html
