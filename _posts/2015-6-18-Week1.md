The first week of Software Engineering gave me an idea of how the rest of the semester is going to be. Professor Downing's teaching style is something that 
I was not expecting. He calls on students randomly to discuss topics that are in lecture that day. What I like about that, is the fact that Professor downi\
g does not make you feel stupid if you dont know the answer. Instead, he walks you through the problem and makes you understand what is happening. I really 
love that because when I been called and dont know the answer, after having that 1 on 1 discussion, i actually retain everything we discussed.

This class overall seems very interesting. I will get to learn a lot of new software tools that I have never used before. The work load seems heavy but I su
ppose it is because we get learn on our own how to use the tools and how to incorporate them into our projects. Even though every time I am in class I feel 
like if I am going to be called on, I am very excited for this semester and I am looking forward for the upcoming cool projects that we will be working on i
n Software Engineering.

TIP OF THE WEEK: It is important to read the material that we will be discussing during next lecture so that when you get called on by the professor, you ca
n actually answer back with ideas or with the right answer.
