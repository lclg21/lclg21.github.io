title: Week 3
---

Generic Programming during the third week was about more advanced topics that i had never encounter before in other languages. For me, it was very difficult to understand it at first. I had to review extra hours and actually code to have a better understanding. Project 2 helped in regards to using back up containers. And throughout the rest of the week, we talked about iterators and the different types there are. It seemed that the 1st midterm was going to take a lot of studying from my part, especially since i had to study for two tests. 

During the third week, i was only able to make it to two lectures. I went on Monday and the Professor talked about containers and iterators. On Wednesday we had a guest speaker that talked about rackspace. For that day, i was able to leave early since the guest speaker was in the previous class giving the same presentation, so Professor Downing let people go home from the previous class. And on Friday, I just couldnt make it to class due to personal reasons. I really did not want to miss because of the exam on Monday, and i think it is always good to go to the lecture before an exam. Now I hope that the exam goes well and ready to start on project 3.

TIP-OF-THE-WEEK: The best way to understand c++ is to practice programming at home even if it is just for a few hours. It helps understand how each topic works and it makes it easier for future projects.
