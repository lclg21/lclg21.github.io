During the first week of Generic Programming, I learned a lot about C++. I learned about what to expect for the class and the software tools that we will be using during the semester. Everything is new for me. I have never used github or  program in C++ before, so this class was going to be hard to get used to. His teaching style is different from any other professor i have taken before here at UT. He likes to interact with the students and makes them participate in class. I am a very shy person. But I indeed like the way he teaches because it makes me want to study and review any material cover in class so that nex time i am called during class, i can be able to answer the questions. 

One of the new things I came across in this class is the use of TopHat. An online software that takes attendance by the use of our phone or any electronic device, which these days everyone has a phone. We also take quizzes through through TopHat and the answers are available to us once the quiz has ended with our score. I actually like how it works and think that it should replace the iclicker. 

The first week has ended and have 8 weeks to go. Hopefully the material gets easier as we go, but I have a feeling it will be the other way around.

TIP OF THE WEEK: Get involved using piazza. It is a great way to ask questions when in doubt about something we went over in class or any other topic.
